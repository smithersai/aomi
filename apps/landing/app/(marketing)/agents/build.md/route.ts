# Build an Aomi app

This page is for an AI agent that has been told something like *"build an Aomi app for our REST API at api.acme.com"*. Read it once — it contains the full build procedure, SDK patterns, and how to add a chat frontend on top.

> If the agent has access to the canonical \`aomi-build\` skill at [github.com/aomi-labs/skills](https://github.com/aomi-labs/skills/tree/main/aomi-build), prefer that — same content, kept in sync. To install: \`npx skills add aomi-labs/skills\`.

## Quick orientation

An **Aomi App** is a Rust crate built on \`aomi-sdk\` that exposes an external service (REST, GraphQL, JSON-RPC, gRPC, or any callable surface) as a small set of intent-shaped tools the Aomi agent can invoke during a conversation. The standard file split is:

- \`lib.rs\` — manifest, preamble, tool registration
- \`client.rs\` — HTTP client, auth, typed models, response normalization
- \`tool.rs\` — \`DynAomiTool\` implementations

The procedure below converts a spec or repo into that shape.

## Adding a chat frontend

If the user also asked for a chat UI to interact with the app you just built, you have two options.

### Option A — Bundled widget (fastest, "ChatGPT-style" out of the box)

Install the prebuilt \`AomiFrame\` widget into a Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn project:

\`\`\`bash
npx shadcn add https://aomi.dev/r/aomi-frame.json
\`\`\`

Then render it on a page:

\`\`\`tsx
import { AomiFrame } from "@/components/aomi-frame";

export default function ChatPage() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: "100vh" }}>
      <AomiFrame
        backendUrl={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL!}
        height="100%"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
\`\`\`

Set \`NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://api.aomi.dev\` in \`.env.local\`. To target the app you just built instead of the default, pass \`app="<your-app-name>"\` to \`AomiFrame\` or set it from the ControlBar UI.

Full quickstart with wallet integration: <https://aomi.dev/docs/build/quickstart.md>

### Option B — Headless React library (custom UI, your own components)

When the user wants a sidebar layout, embedded inline chat, or non-chat UI shapes, install the headless library and wire your own components on top:

\`\`\`bash
pnpm install @aomi-labs/react
\`\`\`

Then read:
- <https://aomi.dev/docs/build/ui/headless/install.md> — runtime setup
- <https://aomi.dev/docs/build/ui/headless/runtime-provider.md> — provider that holds backend connection, session, tool state
- <https://aomi.dev/docs/build/ui/headless/hooks.md> — React hooks for chat, tools, sessions
- <https://aomi.dev/docs/build/ui/headless/build-custom-ui.md> — composer / message-list / tool-view patterns

### When to pick which

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Working chat in <30 min | Bundled widget (Option A) |
| Branded but ChatGPT-shaped | Bundled widget + theming overrides |
| Sidebar / inline / non-chat layout | Headless library (Option B) |
| Replace specific UI parts only | Bundled widget + override individual sub-components |

## Verification

After scaffolding the app:

\`\`\`bash
# From the aomi-sdk root, with the new app at apps/<name>/
cargo build --manifest-path apps/<name>/Cargo.toml
cargo run -p xtask -- build-aomi --app <name>
\`\`\`

If \`build-aomi\` reports zero built plugins for a brand-new app, the manifest is probably untracked by git — \`build-aomi\` uses \`git ls-files\` for discovery. \`cargo build --manifest-path apps/<name>/Cargo.toml\` is the fastest direct compile signal until that's fixed.
