          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>
            Agentic payments are often described as a new payment method, but
            they are not a single rail or product. They are a seven-layer system
            that begins with agent-facing demand and ends in deterministic
            settlement, with assurance running across every layer. This paper
            maps that stack, places the major actors within it, and assesses the
            use cases and emerging services most likely to mature first. The map
            exposes an unresolved responsibility between adaptive reasoning and
            financial authority: converting an agent&apos;s plan into a concrete
            action, testing it against live state, preserving the payload
            presented for authorization, executing without duplication, and
            proving the intended outcome. We interpret this as the financial
            instance of a broader shift toward domain-specific harnesses:
            systems that surround general models with trusted context,
            structured workflows, authority boundaries, and domain-specific
            evaluation. The execution harness is distinct from models,
            toolkits, wallets, payment protocols, and settlement rails because
            it is accountable for stateful completion across them. A useful
            harness should help the same model complete the same task more
            reliably, with fewer tokens, delays, retries, unsafe actions, and
            human interventions. We argue that harness interfaces may
            standardize as the market matures, while execution quality remains
            differentiated.

          <b>Bottom line</b>
          <p>
            Agentic payments are a seven-layer stack that begins with adaptive
            demand and ends in deterministic settlement. Most layers already
            have clear categories: applications, runtimes, wallets, payment
            protocols, money infrastructure, and settlement rails. Legal and
            clinical AI show the broader specialization pattern: general models
            become operational through domain knowledge, structured workflows,
            controls, and outcome-specific evaluation. Financial execution needs
            its own domain-specific harness: machinery that reliably carries an
            agent&apos;s intent across the seven layers and proves that the requested
            outcome occurred.

            We identify seven layers that together carry an agentic payment from
            an adaptive goal to deterministic movement of value. Each layer owns
            a distinct responsibility, and no single protocol, wallet, runtime,
            or rail represents the whole system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reading downward, agent surfaces originate demand; runtimes maintain
            the task; domain execution converts a plan into concrete actions;
            wallets and mandates control authority; payment protocols coordinate
            acceptance; funding systems supply value; and settlement rails
            provide finality. Trust, security, compliance, observability, and
            reconciliation cut horizontally across all seven layers.

            This stack is the paper&apos;s starting point. It separates adjacent
            markets before asking where responsibility is still incomplete.
            The gap appears between adaptive planning and financial authority:
            someone must construct, test, execute, recover, and reconcile the
            action across the other layers. Section 5 names that missing
            category only after the market evidence and boundaries are clear.

          <h3>2.1 What counts as an agentic payment?</h3>
          <p>
            A conventional automated payment follows predetermined code: send a
            fixed amount on a fixed date. An agentic payment contains an
            adaptive decision step: find a compliant supplier under a budget,
            choose a route, determine the amount or timing, and pay. The agent
            may decide <i>what</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>where</i>, or{" "}
            <i>how much</i> within a delegated mandate.
          </p>
          <p>
            A complete agentic payment requires more than a checkout button. It
            runs through seven stages, and the stages do not share the same
            character: the first three are adaptive and reversible, while the
            last four must be deterministic.
          </p>
          <Figure

            caption={
              <>
                Stages 1–3 are adaptive and still reversible. Stage 4 is the
                authorization boundary: a deterministic decision about whether
                the constructed request may use financial authority. Stages 5–7
                must fund, settle, and reconcile without reinterpreting the
                instruction.

            Agentic payments overlap with two larger categories but are not

            comparison, ordering, fulfillment, returns, and support; payment is
            one stage. <b>Agentic finance</b> includes trading, treasury,
            hedging, lending, compliance, and portfolio operations; not every
            financial action is a payment. A crypto agent that only analyzes or
            communicates becomes a payment actor only when it can request or
            authorize value transfer.

          <h3>2.2 The probabilistic–deterministic boundary</h3>
          <p>
            The IMF&apos;s 2026 model separates agentic payments into intent and
            orchestration, control and authorization, and settlement.
            <Cite n="1" />
            That separation captures the core safety property: an agent may
            reason, search, negotiate, and propose, but a deterministic boundary
            must decide whether a concrete request may use financial authority,
            and a deterministic rail must settle without reinterpreting the
            instruction. This paper expands the commercial and technical space
            between those three institutional layers.

          <h3>2.3 Research method</h3>
          <p>
            The analysis combines official protocol specifications, first-party
            product documentation, independent onchain evidence, and Aomi
            Labs&apos; operating perspective. The market taxonomy, player map, and
            use-case maturity assessments extend an earlier ecosystem deep dive
            published by Aomi Labs Research in August 2026, which remains the
            underlying survey for this paper.
            <Cite n="17" /> Product capabilities are treated as vendor claims
            unless independently demonstrated. Transaction activity is evidence
            of technical use, not automatically evidence of durable or
            autonomous demand. The market taxonomy is analytical: firms often
            span multiple layers, and placement reflects the function being
            evaluated rather than the company as a whole.

        >
          <p>
            The seven-layer model becomes useful when it assigns each function
            to the actors that actually perform it. A protocol, wallet, runtime,
            funding provider, or settlement rail may span several layers, but
            no one label should be mistaken for the whole system.
          </p>
          <h3>Layer 1 — Agent surfaces and vertical applications</h3>
          <p>
            Agent surfaces own the user or business workflow and originate
            demand. OpenAI and Stripe&apos;s Agentic Commerce Protocol, for
            example, allows a conversational surface to pass a structured order
            and a scoped payment token to a merchant while the merchant retains
            responsibility for acceptance and fulfillment.
            <Cite n="9" /> Crypto surfaces go further. Bankr combines a
            conversational agent, wallet, cross-chain trading, scheduled
            automations, and x402 service access in one runtime.
            <Cite n="16" /> Virtuals&apos; EconomyOS gives agents identity,
            wallets, permissions, jobs, and programmable capital, with its own
            Agent Commerce Protocol for inter-agent work.
            <Cite n="25" /> That Virtuals “ACP” is a different specification
            from the Stripe and OpenAI Agentic Commerce Protocol despite the
            shared acronym.
          </p>
          <h3>Layer 2 — Agent runtime and orchestration</h3>
          <p>
            Beneath the surface, runtimes own sessions, memory, tools, retries,
            background work, and multistep state. Toolkits and runtimes should
            be distinguished: Coinbase describes AgentKit as a modular,
            framework- and wallet-agnostic system of action providers and wallet
            providers.
            <Cite n="6" /> A stateful execution runtime goes further by owning
            the path to completion and the evidence left behind.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Layer 3 — Domain execution and transaction construction
          </h3>
          <p>
            Domain-execution providers then supply the exact mechanics of a
            swap, bridge, order, checkout, staking operation, or protocol call.
            This is where generic tool calling becomes domain execution: ABI
            handling, route selection, calldata construction, balance and
            allowance checks, slippage, gas, bridge state, failure semantics,
            and post-execution verification. Vertical providers are strong while
            the action stays inside their domain — 1inch Business MCP for swaps
            and portfolios, deBridge MCP for cross-chain routing, Uniswap skills
            for liquidity workflows, Kraken CLI and MCP for exchange trading and
            staking, Crossmint for agentic checkout and merchant-of-record
            flows. The unresolved question is whether execution consolidates
            into broad runtimes or remains a federation of protocol-owned tools.
            The likely answer is both: broad runtimes orchestrate, while
            specialists own routes, liquidity, inventory, and domain-specific
            guarantees.
          </p>
          <h3>Layer 4 — Identity, mandates, wallets, and signing</h3>
          <p>
            Layer four is becoming the center of competition. Google&apos;s AP2
            binds an agent&apos;s action to cryptographically verifiable
            mandates describing identity, scope, limits, and conditions, and
            includes an x402 extension for stablecoin payments.
            <Cite n="4" />
            Visa&apos;s Trusted Agent Protocol helps a merchant recognize an
            approved agent and verify cryptographically signed commerce intent;
            Mastercard Agent Pay extends tokenized credentials and network
            controls to agents.
            <Cite n="10" />
            <Cite n="11" /> Crypto wallets are evolving from key stores into
            programmable authorization systems with:
          </p>
          <ul className={styles.priorities}>
            {walletControls.map((control) => (
              <li key={control}>{control}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <p>
            The crypto-native wallet models are diverging rather than
            converging. Coinbase Agentic Wallets isolate keys in a TEE and add
            session and transaction caps, KYT screening, x402, and gasless
            trading on Base.
            <Cite n="12" /> MetaMask Agent Wallet stays self-custodial and makes
            simulation mandatory, with Blockaid scanning, MEV protection, spend
            limits, allowlists, and human 2FA escalation.
            <Cite n="13" /> OKX pairs TEE-protected keys and risk scoring with
            gas-free X Layer use across nearly twenty chains.
            <Cite n="22" /> Privy provides server wallets and scoped browser
            authorization while Turnkey evaluates signing policies inside secure
            enclaves.
            <Cite n="14" />
            <Cite n="15" /> MoonPay&apos;s Open Wallet Standard proposes an open
            agent-to-wallet interface with a local encrypted vault and
            multichain signing.
            <Cite n="24" /> Crossmint and Circle instead sell the full stack:
            wallets, policies, funding, payment protocols, and service access in
            one integration.

          <h3>
            Layer 5 — Payment coordination and acceptance protocols
          </h3>
          <p>
            Layer five tells an agent what is for sale, how much it costs, which
            payment methods are accepted, what proof is required, and how the
            service is delivered. These protocol families are frequently
            conflated and should not be.

            </table>
          </div>
          <p>
            The distinction in the last row matters most. MCP and A2A expose
            tools and coordinate agents; payment can be layered onto their
            calls, but they are not payment rails. Within machine payments, x402
            facilitators verify signed payloads and submit settlement without
            custodying funds.
            <Cite n="20" /> MPP, co-authored by Stripe and Tempo, coordinates
            payment for APIs, MCP tools, and HTTP endpoints and supports
            microtransactions and recurring charges, reaching stablecoins,
            cards, and buy-now-pay-later methods while preserving tax, fraud,
            reporting, refunds, and normal merchant payouts.
            <Cite n="3" /> ACP and UCP address commerce rather than raw payment:
            ACP lets an agent surface pass a structured order and scoped token
            to a merchant who remains responsible for acceptance, tax,
            fulfillment, and returns, while UCP standardizes discovery and
            checkout across surfaces. The competitive boundary is whether
            merchants adopt an open protocol directly or rely on an orchestrator
            — Stripe, Coinbase, Circle, Crossmint, Bankr — to hide the protocol
            complexity.
          </p>
          <h3>Layer 6 — Money, funding, and treasury infrastructure</h3>
          <p>
            Stablecoins are the default crypto asset for agentic payments
            because agents need predictable unit pricing, 24/7 availability,
            global reach, programmability, and settlement smaller than
            card-network minimum economics. Circle claims USDC represents 99.8%
            of x402 transaction value and has built agent wallets, nanopayments,
            a CLI, skills, and a service marketplace around that position.
            <Cite n="19" /> Treat that percentage as a current vendor-reported
            ecosystem statistic, not a permanent market share.
          </p>
          <p>
            Funding remains the bottleneck. An agent wallet without reliable
            onramps, treasury policies, gas sponsorship, balance monitoring, FX,
            and accounting is only a demo — which is why full-stack providers
            keep bundling these functions rather than leaving customers to
            assemble separate wallet, onramp, facilitator, and compliance
            vendors.
          </p>
          <h3>Layer 7 — Settlement rails</h3>
          <p>
            At layer seven, different rails win different jobs. Base offers
            cheap EVM settlement with x402 and Coinbase distribution; Solana
            offers throughput and low fees with strong stablecoin and
            marketplace activity; Tempo is payment-optimized and the native home
            for MPP sessions and streaming payments;
            <Cite n="27" /> Ethereum and its L2s hold the deepest
            programmable-finance and account-abstraction ecosystem; card
            networks retain unmatched merchant acceptance, disputes, consumer
            protection, and issuer controls; bank rails carry regulated
            account-to-account flows, payroll, and fiat-native settlement. The
            likely endpoint is cross-rail orchestration, not a crypto-only or
            card-only world.
          </p>
          <h3>3.1 Horizontal assurance across all seven layers</h3>
          <p>
            Trust, security, compliance, and observability do not sit at one
            level. They cut across all seven, and the controls divide cleanly by
            when they run.

            Chainalysis combines KYT, sanctions screening, fraud intelligence,
            and pre-signing threat detection, and argues for auditable autonomy
            rather than unconstrained automation.
            <Cite n="26" /> This horizontal layer is likely to become a major
            standalone market precisely because neither a model nor a wallet can
            independently validate the entire economic outcome. These
            responsibilities can be vertically integrated for convenience, but
            they carry different competencies and liabilities, and mature buyers
            will require the boundaries to remain inspectable even when one
            provider bundles several layers.

          <h3>4.1 Emerging service sectors</h3>
          <p className={styles.lead}>
            Financial agents need more than access to money. To operate beyond
            demos, they must receive bounded authority, find trustworthy
            counterparties, execute correctly, choose the right rail, and remain
            accountable after settlement. Each unresolved need creates a market
            for specialized infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Authority must be both programmable and attributable. Credentials
            need isolation, mandates must encode scope and limits, and merchants
            must know which agent is acting for which principal. This creates two
            related but distinct markets: wallets that control access to money,
            and identity, mandate, and reputation systems that establish the
            legitimacy of its use.
            <Cite n="12" />
            <Cite n="14" />
            <Cite n="15" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Markets must also become legible and usable by software. Agents need
            structured descriptions of services, prices, schemas, and delivery
            terms; sellers need gateways that abstract verification and
            settlement. Discovery without reputation becomes spam, while
            payment without delivery proof invites fraud, so marketplaces will
            increasingly incorporate attestations, service histories, and
            escrow.
          </p>
          <p>
            A valid payment is not necessarily a correct action. Systems must
            test transaction semantics before signing, verify the resulting
            state, and select among stablecoin, card, bank, and local rails
            according to the task&apos;s economic and regulatory requirements. This
            separates execution assurance, which determines what should happen,
            from payment orchestration, which determines how value should move.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, autonomous spending must close the operational loop. Every
            balance change, receipt, gas cost, refund, and tax event must map back
            to an agent, mandate, task, user, and result. When the result is
            wrong, settlement finality is insufficient; the system still needs
            proof of delivery, recourse, and a clear allocation of liability.

            million in volume. Speculative activity drove part of the earlier
            surge, so these figures demonstrate technical reach rather than
            durable autonomous demand.

            <Cite n="3" /> Evidence weakens after settlement: treasury and
            reconciliation mostly extend general payment tooling, while Visa and
            Artemis find no settled way to unwind disputes across chains of
            agents.

          <h3>4.3 Use-case maturity</h3>
          <p>
            Use cases mature fastest when the purchased object is digital, the
            price is machine-readable, fulfillment is immediate, and failure is
            reversible or low value. They mature more slowly as physical
            fulfillment, regulated advice, custody, credit, cross-border
            compliance, or ambiguous liability enters the workflow.
          </p>

                Maturity is read from Table 2, which follows. Complexity and
                market size are
                assessments, not measurements, so the axes are drawn as named
                zones and bubble area as four steps rather than numeric scales.
                Size asks how much spend a category could eventually address,
                which is why treasury and procurement stay large while sitting
                low on maturity. Colour restates the maturity band. The trend is
                the report&apos;s own claim — value falls as physical
                fulfilment, regulated advice, custody, credit, or ambiguous
                liability enters the workflow — and the informative part is the
                exception. Compliance and investigation workflows sit high on
                complexity and high on maturity because a human stays
                accountable at the end of them.

            This sequence explains crypto&apos;s early advantage. Wallets are
            programmatic accounts; stablecoins provide internet-native value;
            and blockchains settle globally at machine speed. Those properties
            are especially valuable for low-value digital services and
            crypto-native financial actions. They are less decisive in consumer
            commerce, where merchant reach, refunds, fraud allocation, tax, and
            fulfillment usually matter more than the novelty of the rail.

          <p className={styles.lead}>
            The seven-layer map reveals a responsibility that the market has not
            consistently named: carrying an agent&apos;s adaptive plan into a
            concrete, inspectable, and reconciled financial outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            General-purpose agents can already reach financial destinations.
            They can browse documentation, discover a tool, infer its schema,
            create a payment or transaction, recover from an error, and inspect
            a receipt. Yet they often do so the way a person travels on foot:
            one uncertain step at a time, repeatedly paying in reasoning,
            tokens, latency, and operational risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Faster models improve that walk. They do not remove the economic
            reason to build vehicles. In mature technical systems, repeated
            integration knowledge, safety checks, and recovery logic move out of
            general reasoning and into software. The model remains the
            intelligence; an execution harness carries the known mechanics.
          </p>
          <p className={styles.lead}>
            A payment protocol can coordinate a handshake, and a wallet can
            decide whether to sign. Neither can independently establish that an
            adaptive financial task was correctly completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider an instruction to bridge an asset, pay for a service on the
            destination chain, and return a receipt. The agent must interpret
            constraints, select a bridge and service, obtain quotes, construct
            approvals and calls, reason about destination gas, handle changing
            state, preserve the request reviewed by the signer, recover from a
            partial bridge, prevent duplicate payment, verify delivery, and
            reconcile the final balances. A wallet can enforce a spend cap. A
            simulator can test a concrete transaction. A chain can prove
            finality. None alone can connect the semantic objective to the whole
            sequence of evidence.

            <b>Central thesis</b>
            <p>
              As agentic finance matures, execution harnesses become standard
              infrastructure because they increase verified outcomes per unit of
              model reasoning, time, money, and human attention. Their
              interfaces may commoditize; their execution quality will not.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h3>5.1 Definition</h3>
          <p>
            An <b>execution harness</b> is the runtime machinery that converts
            adaptive intent into bounded, inspectable, and reconcilable
            financial action. It is more than a toolkit because it owns state,
            recovery, and completion. It is broader than a policy layer because
            policy does not construct or reconcile the task. It remains separate
            from the wallet because the wallet must retain the independent power
            to refuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            The harness does not replace the seven payment stages in Figure 2;
            it decomposes the work inside them. Its responsibilities cover
            stages one through three, the simulation that precedes the
            authorization request, and the reconciliation that closes the task.
            It never owns stage four. Authority stays with the wallet, funding
            with the balance, and finality with the rail.

                payload, simulation, authorization decision, signer, receipt,
                and final state.

          <h3>5.2 Why better models do not eliminate the category</h3>
          <p>
            General models will continue to improve at documentation discovery,
            schema inference, tool use, and error recovery. That lowers the cost
            of walking; it does not change the value of a tested route. Mature
            systems do not ask a model to rediscover stable protocol knowledge,
            allowance rules, idempotency semantics, receipt formats, or balance
            assertions on every run. They encode those mechanics and reserve
            model reasoning for decisions that are genuinely adaptive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Legal and clinical AI provide an instructive precedent, even though
            those companies do not necessarily use the term “harness.” Harvey
            distinguishes individual models from model systems, agents, and
            workflows. Its legal workflows combine task-specific tools and
            knowledge sources with structured steps, citation requirements,
            human review, and evaluations based on completed legal work.
            <Cite n="28" /> Abridge turns clinical conversations into billable,
            EHR-integrated notes and actionable outputs, tying drafts back to
            source information for clinician review.
            <Cite n="29" /> Hippocratic AI describes a safety process built
            around output testing, clinical supervision, escalation to human
            nurses, and cross-validation against real interactions.

            The shared pattern is not simply more domain knowledge. Stable
            professional mechanics move out of repeated prompting and into
            software that owns workflow, evidence, review, and evaluation.
            Financial execution follows the same pattern with a stricter end
            state: the output can move assets irreversibly. Its domain-specific
            harness must therefore own transaction construction, simulation,
            immutable authorization handoff, idempotency, recovery, and
            reconciliation—not merely produce a more informed financial answer.

            The analogy must be applied strictly. A poor vehicle can be slower
            than walking. A harness that hides failures, constrains a capable
            model, increases retries, or cannot demonstrate the final state has
            not earned its abstraction. The relevant comparison is the same
            athlete on the same course: one model and task set, with and without
            the harness.

            Early markets reward full-stack products because developers prefer
            one API and users prefer one trusted surface. Coinbase, Circle,
            Crossmint, Stripe, Bankr, and OKX therefore span layers. Yet
            specialization is likely to deepen because each layer has a distinct
            technical competency, distribution advantage, and liability model.
            Models optimize reasoning; runtimes manage state; wallets control
            authority; protocols coordinate; issuers manage money; rails provide
            finality; risk vendors provide independent evidence. As stakes rise,
            buyers will demand modularity and independent checks.

          <h3>6.1 Market structure and competitive dynamics</h3>
          <p>
            <b>Wallets own the strongest distribution moat.</b> They already
            control assets, trust, signing, and the gateway to settlement, which
            gives MetaMask, Coinbase, OKX, Phantom, and institutional custody
            providers a path upward into agent controls and execution. Runtimes
            should treat wallets as distribution and authority partners rather
            than as competitors to displace.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Protocols converge by function, not toward one standard.</b> x402
            and MPP overlap in machine payments; ACP and UCP overlap in commerce
            workflows; AP2, Visa, and Mastercard focus on mandates and trusted
            agents; MCP and A2A coordinate tools and agents. These can coexist
            because they solve different parts of the journey. Durable providers
            will support several protocols while preserving one stable internal
            authorization and accounting model.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Stablecoins are the crypto wedge, not the whole product.</b> They
            solve global, programmable, low-value settlement. They do not solve
            agent identity, merchant acceptance, delivery disputes, refunds,
            taxes, wallet policy, or safe construction. The market will reward
            teams that pair stablecoins with those missing layers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Transaction counts can mislead.</b> The x402 data is promising
            but should not be presented as pure autonomous-agent adoption.
            Chainalysis attributes a major Q4 2025 spike to meme-coin
            pay-to-mint loops and holds that mass adoption remains distant.
            <Cite n="5" />
          </p>
          <p>
            Taken together, these dynamics set the bar for anyone in layers two
            and three. Payment platforms can move inward from money movement
            into orchestration; vertical providers can dominate high-frequency
            domains through route, venue, or inventory depth; general agent
            frameworks can move downward through wallet and payment plugins.
            Execution runtimes must therefore prove that they are materially
            better at generalized completion and evidence, not merely better at
            exposing transactions to an LLM.

          <p>
            Model tokens are not the only operational cost, but they reveal the
            underlying inefficiency. When an agent rereads documentation,
            reconstructs schemas, reasons through stable allowance mechanics,
            retries stale routes, or investigates whether a task finished, the
            system is buying cognition to compensate for missing infrastructure.
            Harness value comes from moving repeated cognition into software,
            compressing the failure surface, and making operations legible.
          </p>
          <p>
            This produces a stricter economic claim than “agents work better
            with tools.” A useful harness should increase the number of verified
            outcomes obtained from a fixed model budget. It should also preserve
            model optionality: operators can improve or replace the model
            without rebuilding every financial integration and control around
            it.

            Our thesis at Aomi Labs is that agentic finance will require a
            distinct execution-harness layer. Our work focuses on its onchain
            instance: infrastructure that turns agent intent into verified
            financial execution across payment and non-payment actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            That work sits primarily in layers two and three: runtime
            orchestration and domain execution. It encompasses the agent loop,
            tools, sessions, persistence, and multistep state; translates intent
            into typed actions and transactions; simulates expected outcomes;
            and prepares a concrete request for an external signer.

          <p>
            We are not proposing a new wallet, stablecoin, payment protocol,
            facilitator, card network, or settlement chain. “Policy layer” and
            “transaction firewall” are also too narrow: policy and guards are
            subsystems inside a broader runtime. The research concerns a
            generalized execution surface — pay, swap, bridge, lend, stake,
            trade, deploy, call APIs, and reconcile outcomes.

                The runtime coordinates execution and evidence. The wallet

          <h3>8.4 Competitive threats</h3>
          <p>
            Four vectors converge on layers two and three. Wallets can move
            upward: Coinbase, MetaMask, OKX, Circle, Privy, and Turnkey can all
            add tools and construction above the signing boundary they already
            own. Payment platforms can move inward: Stripe and Crossmint can add
            orchestration around money movement. Vertical execution providers —
            Bankr, 1inch, deBridge, Uniswap, and the exchanges — may own
            high-frequency domains outright. And general agent frameworks can
            move downward, adding wallets and payment plugins to existing
            distribution. The Aomi Labs thesis therefore depends on specialized
            infrastructure being materially better at generalized, verified
            onchain execution than a wallet assistant or a protocol-specific
            skill.

            Liability deserves separate emphasis because it cuts across all of
            them. It remains fragmented across user, model provider, runtime,
            tool, wallet, facilitator, merchant, issuer, and settlement rail,
            and regulatory classification can change with custody, payment
            initiation, brokerage, advice, sanctions exposure, or jurisdiction.
            A technically successful design may still fail if no participant
            clearly owns refunds, disputes, exceptions, and loss.

          <h3>9.2 Outlook</h3>
          <p>
            Over the next twelve months, wallets are likely to make
            agent-specific policies, escalation, and transaction security
            default features. x402 and MPP will compete for paid APIs while
            processors support both. ACP, UCP, and AP2 integrations will expand
            across merchant systems, and stablecoin issuers will bundle wallets,
            discovery, compliance, and nanopayments. DeFi agents will remain
            valuable but risk-tolerant early adopters. Independent security and
            observability will become enterprise requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over a two-to-three-year horizon, agents should carry portable
            mandates and credentials across surfaces; service marketplaces
            should expose machine-readable price, capability, reputation, and
            delivery guarantees; cross-rail routers should choose among
            stablecoin, card, bank, and local rails automatically; and agent
            treasury and accounting should become standard enterprise
            infrastructure. Durable systems will separate proposer, executor,
            authorizer, and settler while linking all four through evidence. At
            that point “agentic payments” stops being a category and becomes a
            capability embedded in runtimes, wallets, commerce platforms, and
            financial software.

          <h3>9.3 A decision checklist for any player</h3>
          <p>
            The taxonomy in this paper is only useful if it can place a real
            company quickly. Ten questions do most of that work, and the last
            two are usually the most revealing.
          </p>
          <ol className={styles.priorities}>
            {checklist.map(([question, answer]) => (
              <li key={question}>
                <b>{question}</b> {answer}.
              </li>
            ))}
          </ol>
          <h3>9.4 Conclusion</h3>
          <p className={styles.conclusion}>
            Agentic payments will not mature simply because models receive
            wallets. They will mature when software can form an adaptive intent,
            turn it into a valid and inspectable action, operate within
            delegated authority, settle through the appropriate rail, and prove
            that the requested outcome occurred. Better models will become
            better athletes. Execution harnesses are the vehicles that let the
            same athlete travel farther, faster, and with evidence.
